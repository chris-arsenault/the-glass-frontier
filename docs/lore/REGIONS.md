# REGIONS.md

## Canon Overview
- The surface of **Kaleidos** fractures into resonant corridors where geography, climate, and anchor nodes co-author the lived experience of settlements.
- Every region is logged with a persistent `region.*` identifier and maintains a roster of `anchor.*` sites drawn from `RESONANCE_ANCHORS.md` to aid Story Consolidation and moderation review.
- Regions inherit celestial context from `COSMOLOGY.md`, tying Prismwell lanes, Lattice vault access, and Rooted biomes into a single navigational lexicon for freeform play.

## Region Profiles (Status: Canon)

### Auric Steppe Corridor (`region.auric-steppe`)
- **Anchor Roster:** `anchor.prism-spire.auric-step`, `anchor.echo-well.morrow-hollow`
- **Geography & Tone:** Glass-stepped mesas scatter sunlight into auric ribbons, creating reliable sky lanes for kite-sail convoys. Echo Wells bloom beneath ridge shadows, amplifying recorded histories that migratory storytellers broadcast nightly.
- **Story Hooks:** Windblown caravan councils debating charter compliance; downtempo Echo Descent interludes revealing pre-collapse trade alliances; nomad clans vying for Prismwell refraction rights during Glassfall showers.
- **Story Consolidation Tags:** `sc.anchor-region.auric-steppe`, `ner.region.auric-steppe`, `mod.review.anchor.prism-spire.auric-step`

### Sable Crescent Basin (`region.sable-crescent`)
- **Anchor Roster:** `anchor.echo-well.sable-crescent`, `anchor.rooted-grove.glassreed-mire`
- **Geography & Tone:** The basin stages perpetual twilight where mist diffuses Prismwell light into mirrored crescents. Rooted Groves tether flora attunements to Echo Well harmonics, producing communal sanctuaries overseen by charter custodians.
- **Story Hooks:** Community-led Cooling Interlude vigils after resonance overdrafts; conservationists negotiating with Verge refiners over water rights; pilgrim processions diving the Echo Well for archival mandates.
- **Story Consolidation Tags:** `sc.anchor-region.sable-crescent`, `ner.region.sable-crescent`, `mod.review.anchor.echo-well.sable-crescent`

### Kyther Range Vault (`region.kyther-range`)
- **Anchor Roster:** `anchor.prism-spire.kyther-range`, `anchor.lattice-gate.vigil-breach`
- **Geography & Tone:** Jagged ridges crest above perpetual snowfields; prism-veined tunnels feed Lattice Gates carved into cliffside bastions. Custodian drones patrol resonance thresholds, enforcing phased-key authenticity.
- **Story Hooks:** Expedition clocks racing avalanche fronts; phased key crafting montages interwoven with Solo Harmonic Trials; moderator-assisted audits of relic caches discovered within Vigil Breach vaults.
- **Story Consolidation Tags:** `sc.anchor-region.kyther-range`, `ner.region.kyther-range`, `mod.review.anchor.lattice-gate.vigil-breach`

### Obolith Verge Chain (`region.obilith-verge`)
- **Anchor Roster:** `anchor.lattice-gate.obolith`, `anchor.verge-conduit.hoarfrost-line`
- **Geography & Tone:** Suspended platforms anchor to the Obolith shard, lashed by auroral scrap squalls. Verge Conduits siphon storm energy into refineries while Lattice access points pulse with AI oversight.
- **Story Hooks:** Smuggler flotillas attempting Verge Slipsail Runs under moderator scrutiny; custodian distress signals forcing emergency downtime sequences; trade unions lobbying for safer resonance damping infrastructure.
- **Story Consolidation Tags:** `sc.anchor-region.obilith-verge`, `ner.region.obilith-verge`, `mod.review.anchor.verge-conduit.hoarfrost-line`

### Lumenshard Greenway (`region.lumenshard-green`)
- **Anchor Roster:** `anchor.rooted-grove.lumenshard-green`, `anchor.verge-conduit.sirocco-yard`
- **Geography & Tone:** Bioluminescent canopy corridors weave Rooted Groves into Verge trade lanes. Resonant flora glow in response to attunement rites, guiding caravans through safe passages toward Verge conduits.
- **Story Hooks:** Eco-faction tribunals arbitrating magitech usage quotas; barter festivals exchanging resonance scrip for botanical insights; clandestine cooling rituals protecting the groves from industrial overdraw.
- **Story Consolidation Tags:** `sc.anchor-region.lumenshard-green`, `ner.region.lumenshard-green`, `mod.review.anchor.rooted-grove.lumenshard-green`

## Legends & Fringe Paths (Status: Legend)
| Legend | Contradictions | Guidance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Auric Flight Ascendancy** | Claims a caravan mastered continuous Prismwell flight across the Auric Steppe without charter approval. No custodian logs confirm sustained airborne residency. | Treat as aspirational folklore motivating aerial clans; require moderator sign-off before granting mechanical benefits. |
| **Obolith Whisper Vault** | Rumored hidden vault beneath the Obolith shard supposedly granting direct custodian communion. Conflicts with Lattice access protocols recorded in RESONANCE_ANCHORS.md. | Use as suspenseful rumor in smuggler arcs; never canonize without a logged Story Consolidation decision. |

## Story Consolidation Hooks
- Record session transcripts with combined tags (`region.*`, `anchor.*`, `sc.anchor-region.*`) to accelerate entity linking in post-session pipelines.
- Align downtime scenes with attunement rites (`ritual.attunement.*`) already cataloged in RESONANCE_ANCHORS.md so cooldown schedules remain auditable.
- Surface moderator alerts via `mod.review.anchor.[site]` whenever regional actions risk Prohibited Capabilities drift, ensuring DES-MOD-01 dependencies inherit the telemetry.

## Integration Notes
- Reference `COSMOLOGY.md` for resonance band behavior affecting travel between the Prismwell, Verge, and Rooted layers across these regions.
- Cross-link `RESONANCE_ANCHORS.md` identifiers to maintain a single source of truth for anchor definitions and custodian oversight.
- Future faction (NAR-25/26) and anomaly (NAR-29) sessions should extend these regions with faction influence matrices and unique phenomena, reusing the entity IDs defined here for continuity.
