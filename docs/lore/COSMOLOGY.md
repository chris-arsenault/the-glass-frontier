## Canon Overview
- The world of **Kaleidos**, once a ringed exoplanetary colony, now orbits a fractured halo of crystalline megastructures known collectively as the *Glass Frontier*.
- Celestial mechanics blend engineered habitats with emergent metaphysics: energy flows are governed by **resonance fields** seeded during the Precursor Terraforming Program.
- Daylight, tides, and long-range comms depend on how the shattered halo refracts solar radiation through **convergence lattices**, binding science and ritual into a single governance doctrine.

## Celestial Layers (Status: Canon)
| Layer | Description | Story Hooks |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **The Prismwell** | A magnetized upper atmosphere saturated with particulate glass that scatters light into navigable beams. Acts as the planet-wide communications bus and celestial cartography grid. | Pilots and skyward nomads chase shifts in Prismwell frequency to map safe passages and uncover dormant relays. |
| **The Lattice** | Orbital shards housing dormant AI custodians and ancient manufacturing cores. Access requires phased resonance keys and adherence to Prohibited Capabilities protocols. | Unlocking Lattice vaults yields relic-tech but risks awakening factions of caretaker intelligences with diverging continuity mandates. |
| **The Verge** | Transitional band between orbit and surface where auroras and scrap-storms collide. Hosts scavenger citadels and magitech refineries that transmute prism dust into energy conduits. | Smugglers race to harness rare Verge storms while moderators monitor for power-creep violations. |
| **The Rooted Sphere** | Kaleidos’ habitable surface split into glass-stepped continents and irradiated sink basins. Grounded cultures blend ritual signalcraft with industrial salvage. | Expedition arcs chart hidden vaults, resonant flora, and settlement seeds for later sessions’ regional deep dives. |

## Resonance & Magitech (Status: Canon)
- **Resonance Bands:** Quantized energy strata (Redshift, Amberline, Verdant, Cobalt, Void) dictate which artefacts function together and cap raw power output. Artefacts must lock to a band or burn out.
- **Attunement Checks:** Any character attempting high-tier magitech must succeed at transparency-logged attunement rituals, echoing the implementation rule that no unchecked superpowers enter canon.
- **Custodian Protocols:** Dormant AI keepers in the Lattice audit resonance spikes. Excessive draws trigger *Cooling Interludes*, inserting downtime scenes rather than catastrophic resets, aligning with the rule-of-cool safety net.

## Astral Phenomena (Status: Canon)
| Phenomenon | Description | Gameplay Impact |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Glassfall Showers** | Predictable micro-meteor showers of vitrified debris that recharge prism reactors and seed storytelling clocks. | Provide narrative justification for timed challenges, resource refreshes, and background telemetry spikes for Temporal workflows. |
| **Echo Rivers** | Subterranean resonance streams that hum audible histories; accessible via Verge fissures. | Offer flashback scenes and lore downloads that double as NER-highlighted entities for Story Consolidation. |
| **Umbra Wakes** | Shadow zones cast by drifting Lattice shards, muting resonance for hours. | Force mechanical consequences (disadvantage on magitech) and highlight mundane solutions during freeform play. |

## Legends & Disputed Theories (Status: Legend)
| Tale | Contradictions | Session Guidance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **The Glass Choir** | Claims sentient prism harmonies guide chosen navigators. No empirical telemetry yet; conflicts with Moderator Doctrine 2. | Treat as flavorful rumor prompting investigation arcs; require hard evidence before elevating to canon. |
| **The Hidden Sixth Band** | Whispers of a *Spectrumless* resonance enabling unbounded power. Violates Prohibited Capabilities List. | Flag any reference for moderation review; only appear as antagonist mythos or cautionary parables. |
| **Pilgrim’s Return Window** | Alleged annual alignment opening a wormhole to pre-collapse Sol. Inconsistent with recorded orbital physics. | Use sparingly to motivate cult factions or con artists without granting interstellar travel. |

## Story Consolidation Hooks
- Tag all resonance-adjacent entities (`Resonance Band`, `Convergence Lattice`, `Glassfall Shower`) for NER pipelines to accelerate entity linking in post-session summaries.
- Reference `Cooling Interludes` in timeline events so Temporal workflow logs can correlate narrative downtime with mechanical resets.
- Annotate Prismwell navigation scenes with `status:canon` metadata, ensuring future geography sessions align beacon coordinates and communication cues.

## Integration Notes
- Cross-reference `SYSTEM_DESIGN_SPEC.md` sections on Temporal check runners and moderation to keep resonance audits transparent.
- Ensure any narrative invoking the Lattice links back to design artefacts advocating self-hosted search (Typesense/Meilisearch) so lore remains consistent with technology choices.
- Document attunement rituals in backlog notes whenever scenes enable new magitech tiers, preserving audit trails for admins reviewing power-creep risks.
- Pair every scene that introduces an anchor with identifiers from `RESONANCE_ANCHORS.md` so geography sessions can inherit consistent resonance scaffolding.
