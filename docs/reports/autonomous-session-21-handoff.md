# Autonomous Session 21 Handoff – Narrative Kickoff

**Date:** 2025-11-05  
**Backlog Anchor:** NAR-21 (Cosmology & Historical Timeline Foundations)  
**Narrative Entries:** `54476f33-9ec3-40f9-8b8b-08bfe1e1d20c`, `6ef78c8c-125e-46c2-9de1-302fd344e62e`

## Summary
- Launched the narrative phase by defining Kaleidos’ layered cosmology and resonance-governed magitech in `docs/lore/COSMOLOGY.md`, connecting orbital shards, Prismwell navigation, and custodian protocols to design mandates.
- Established the canonical historical timeline in `docs/lore/CHRONOLOGY.md`, charting eras from the Precursor Dawn through the Tempered Accord with Story Consolidation hooks and entity IDs for downstream pipelines.
- Created the `NAR-CORE` feature and backlog story `NAR-21`, linking artefacts to MCP narrative (`Cosmology of Kaleidos`) and lore (`Chronology of Kaleidos`) records tagged for session 21 provenance.

## Artefacts
- `docs/lore/COSMOLOGY.md` – Canon + legend breakdown of Kaleidos’ celestial layers, resonance bands, and magitech safeguards.
- `docs/lore/CHRONOLOGY.md` – Era table and event log anchoring post-collapse history with telemetry hooks (`event.glassfall.detonation`, `era.tempered-accord`).
- MCP narrative element `54476f33-9ec3-40f9-8b8b-08bfe1e1d20c` (Cosmology of Kaleidos).
- MCP lore entry `6ef78c8c-125e-46c2-9de1-302fd344e62e` (Chronology of Kaleidos).

## Backlog Updates
- Created feature `NAR-CORE: Worldbuilding Foundations` (status: in-progress).
- Added backlog item `NAR-21: Cosmology & Historical Timeline Foundations`, marked **done** with completed work, consistency-check notes, and follow-up actions for geography planning.
- Refreshed `docs/plans/backlog.md` to include `NAR-CORE` status and artefact references.

## Outstanding / Next Steps
- Use resonance anchors and era entities as scaffolding for Session 22 geography deliverables, ensuring regional lore reuses established IDs.
- Capture an architecture decision once resonance governance intersects implementation work (consistency check returned no direct matches).
- Coordinate with moderation design backlog (`DES-MOD-01`) to align Resonance Charter hooks with future admin tooling narratives.

## Verification
- Automated tests: **not run** (narrative documentation only).
- Consistency: `mcp__game-mcp-server__check_consistency` reported no matching entries; log architecture implications when implementation artefacts emerge.
