# Autonomous Session 141 Handoff — Backlog Grooming Cycle

**Date:** 2025-11-05T08:29:42Z  
**Agent:** Codex  
**Focus:** Backlog grooming for Tier 1 gameplay, offline publishing, and unified client delivery

## Summary
- Reopened IMP-GM, IMP-HUBS, IMP-OFFLINE, and IMP-CLIENT features with fresh Cycle 10 PBIs so Tier 1 work stays centered on gameplay systems mandated in `REQUIREMENTS.md`.
- Marked IMP-PLATFORM as delivered to keep platform automation paused, then confirmed WIP remains within limits (only IMP-HUBS-05 is in-progress).
- Refreshed grooming docs and backlog snapshot to capture the new priorities and ensure discoverability for upcoming sessions.

## Backlog Updates
- Added Tier 1 PBIs: IMP-GM-07, IMP-HUBS-06, IMP-OFFLINE-06, and IMP-CLIENT-07; linked each to its feature with detailed acceptance criteria and next steps.
- Left IMP-HUBS-05 active with monitoring/validation tasks and queued IMP-HUBS-06 behind it for fallout quest hooks.
- Retained IMP-MOD-02 as the sole Tier 2 item; no new Tier 3 work opened. WIP = 1 (IMP-HUBS-05), all PBIs feature-linked.

## Documentation Updates
- `docs/BACKLOG_AUDIT.md` — refreshed feature tables to reflect the new Tier 1 backlog and delivered platform feature.
- `docs/NEXT_SPRINT_PLAN.md` — published Sessions 141–150 priority table with Tier 1 focus and reminders.
- `docs/plans/backlog.md` — synchronized tier snapshot with the latest MCP backlog.

## Outstanding / Next Steps
1. Complete IMP-HUBS-05 telemetry monitoring and Temporal validation so the contested PvP work can close cleanly.
2. Begin IMP-OFFLINE-06 once contest artefact contracts stabilize, then wire data into the review queue.
3. Kick off IMP-CLIENT-07 and IMP-GM-07 after IMP-HUBS-05 evidence lands, coordinating overlays with new check narration payloads.
4. Keep IMP-MOD-02 on deck until Tier 1 deliverables expose concrete capability policy gaps.

## Tests
- Not run (backlog grooming only).
