# Autonomous Session 1 Handoff – Research Phase

**Date:** 2025-11-02  
**Backlog Anchor:** RES-01 (cycle 1)  
**Cached Research:** f842e6b4-7606-400a-81fe-8c86769126fb

## Goal Summary
- Established session tone guardrails, naming conventions, and precedent analysis to ground The Glass Frontier’s cooperative GM storytelling.
- Produced reusable artefacts for downstream narrative design, including a tone bible starter and naming toolkit.

## Work Completed
- Created research epic `RES-CORE` and backlog item `RES-01`; marked `RES-01` done after delivering acceptance criteria.
- Authored `docs/research/session-01-narrative-benchmarking.md` with tone archetypes, naming lexicon, and AI-driven narrative comps.
- Cached research findings in MCP (`RES-01-narrative-benchmarking`) for discoverability.

## Key Findings
- Tone archetypes: Shattered Frontier Hopepunk, Mythic Echoes in Ruins, Mystic-Western Tension.
- Naming lexicon patterns balance industrial grit with mystical resonance across factions, locations, relics, and NPC identities.
- AI Dungeon, Hidden Door, and Disco Elysium LLM experiments underscore the need for tone drift safeguards, moderator oversight, and offline consolidation pipelines.

## Implications for Design
- Stand up a tone bible and GM prompt templates seeded with the cited archetypes.
- Equip the memory stack with naming helpers to keep session logs consistent and readable.
- Prioritize offline Story Consolidation tools that blend automated extraction with human moderation to preserve canon.

## Outstanding / Next Steps
- Session 2 (`RES-02`) should expand genre benchmarking toward additional exemplars and validate tone bible integration points.
- Draft tone drift alert heuristics and begin outlining how they surface in the GM console.

## Verification
- No automated tests run; research-only session.
