# Autonomous Session 28 Handoff – Settlements & Magitech Infrastructure Dossiers

**Date:** 2025-11-04  
**Backlog Anchor:** NAR-28 (Settlements & Magitech Infrastructure Dossiers)  
**Narrative Entries:** `df29e84a-e13f-4b34-a01a-69383b948a0a`, `f4455211-979d-42c1-86bd-6b21b1826581`

## Summary
- Authored `docs/lore/SETTLEMENTS.md` to canonize five Kaleidos settlements, threading magitech tier access, relic quotas, and resonance anchors into Day-0 infrastructure stakes.
- Embedded Story Consolidation / NER identifiers (`sc.settlement.*`, `ner.settlement.*`) plus moderation hooks that mirror Session 27 technology canon, keeping DES-MOD-01 automation targets aligned.
- Stored MCP narrative element `df29e84a-e13f-4b34-a01a-69383b948a0a` and lore entry `f4455211-979d-42c1-86bd-6b21b1826581`, refreshed `docs/plans/backlog.md`, and closed NAR-28 with follow-on actions.

## Artefacts
- `docs/lore/SETTLEMENTS.md` – Settlement dossiers covering Glasswake Relay, Morrow Hollow Archive Steps, Vigil Breach Bastion, Hoarfrost Freehold, and Lumenshard Canopy Cooperative plus Spectrum Bloom legend watch.
- MCP narrative element `df29e84a-e13f-4b34-a01a-69383b948a0a` (Settlement Magitech Infrastructure Dossiers).
- MCP lore entry `f4455211-979d-42c1-86bd-6b21b1826581` (Kaleidos Settlement Ledger).
- `docs/plans/backlog.md` – Snapshot updated for Session 28 completion.

## Backlog Updates
- `NAR-28: Settlements & Magitech Infrastructure Dossiers` created and marked **done** with artefacts attached, Story Consolidation hooks logged, and DES-MOD-01 follow-ups noted.
- `mcp__game-mcp-server__check_consistency` (2025-11-04) surfaced architecture cadence references; no blocking conflicts detected.

## Outstanding / Next Steps
- Feed settlement identifiers, tier disparities, and moderation hooks into Session 29 anomaly briefs and Session 30 world bible stitching.
- Coordinate with DES-MOD-01 owners to map settlement-level `mod.review.*` triggers into automation thresholds.
- Mirror the new `sc.settlement.*` / `ner.settlement.*` fields across Story Consolidation templates before anomaly drafting.

## Verification
- Automated tests: **not run** (documentation-only narrative deliverable; no runtime impact).
