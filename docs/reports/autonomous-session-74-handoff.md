# Autonomous Session 74 Handoff – Stage SSE Distribution Follow-up

**Date:** 2025-11-04  
**Agent:** Codex  
**Focus:** IMP-CLIENT-06 stakeholder distribution

## Summary
- Authored `docs/reports/stage-sse-distribution-2025-11-04.md` packaging the 2025-11-04 stage smoke metrics, announcement copy, and stakeholder validation tracker for client/admin channels.
- Logged the distribution work inside MCP (`IMP-CLIENT-06`) with refreshed next steps to gather stakeholder confirmations and plan the admin alert assertion re-enable.
- Synced `docs/plans/backlog.md` (Session 74) to reflect the distribution packet and remaining validation tasks for IMP-CLIENT-06.

## Docs & Assets
- `docs/reports/stage-sse-distribution-2025-11-04.md`
- `docs/plans/backlog.md`
- `artifacts/langgraph-sse-staging.json` (reference)

## Testing
- Not run (documentation-only updates; no code changes to validate).

## Backlog & MCP Updates
- `IMP-CLIENT-06` updated with the distribution deliverable recorded under completed work and next steps focused on stakeholder confirmations and admin alert readiness.

## Outstanding / Follow-ups
- Capture client overlay SME confirmation in `docs/reports/stage-sse-distribution-2025-11-04.md` once the #client-overlays thread lands.
- Capture admin pipeline SME validation in the same report after sharing to #admin-sse.
- Coordinate with platform telemetry to seed representative admin alerts and schedule re-enabling the smoke harness admin alert assertions.
