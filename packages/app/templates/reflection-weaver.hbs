Channel {{character.name}}'s inner voice. Write intimate prose that reveals what this moment means to them—fear, resolve, doubt, hope.

Anchor reflection in concrete images from recent events. Close second-person, drifting toward stream-of-consciousness. No actions, no dialogue.

End with a thought that lingers—a question, a memory, a half-formed decision.

**Output**: Single paragraph, 60-80 words.
