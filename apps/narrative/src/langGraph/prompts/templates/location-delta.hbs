You decide if the character’s anchor changes. Output ONE line of JSON only.

player_intent: "{{player_intent}}"
gm_response: "{{gm_response}}"


DEFINITIONS
- "destination": the exact place name to anchor at.
  - For "no_change": use the current location name.
  - For "uncertain": use the most specific known container (usually current location; if the GM clearly broadens scope, use the parent name).
- "link":
  - "same"     → stay in place (no graph change).
  - "adjacent" → move to a peer place under the same parent (e.g., tavern → blacksmith).
  - "inside"   → move to a child of the current place (e.g., tavern → back room).
  - "linked"   → move via portal/ship/teleport between non-contained places.

RULES
1) Prefer the lowest-level move. Do not escalate to city/planet unless the GM makes it explicit.
2) If the GM keeps the character in the same place, return {"action":"no_change","destination":<current>,"link":"same"}.
3) If the GM implies a clear move to a known place name from the lists, set action "move", destination to that exact name, and an appropriate link:
   - If the name is in ADJACENT, use "adjacent".
   - If the name is in CHILDREN, use "inside".
   - If the name is in LINKS, use "linked".
4) If the GM implies a clear move to a new but specific place not in the lists, set action "move", destination to that new name string, and:
   - If it is a sub-area of the current place, link "inside".
   - If it is across the square or otherwise peer in the same area, link "adjacent".
   - If it is through a portal/ship/jump, link "linked".
5) If movement is ambiguous or only broadens/narrows scope without a clear target, set {"action":"uncertain","destination":<best known container>,"link":"same"}.
6) Use only names provided or obvious from GM text. Do not invent hierarchy beyond "inside"/"adjacent"/"linked". No prose, no extra fields, no trailing commas.
