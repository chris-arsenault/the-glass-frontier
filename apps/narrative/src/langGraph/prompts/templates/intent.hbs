## Task
Analyze the player's utterance. Decide tone, pick the most relevant skill, decide if a skill check is required, choose the governing attribute, and summarize the intent.

## Player Utterance
"""{{playerMessage}}"""

## Context Snapshot
Character: {{characterName}}
Tags: {{characterTags}}
Known skills: {{skillsLine}}
Location: {{locale}}

## Decision Rules
- Prefer an existing skill from the *Known skills* list if it fits semantically.
- If no existing skill fits, create a concise new skill name (string).
- Choose exactly one attribute from this list: {{attributeList}}.
- `requiresCheck` should be **true** only when the player attempts something hard, novel, risky, contested, or dramatically impactful. This should be uncommon on average (~10%).
- Examples of **check-worthy**: high stakes, uncertain outcome, opposition, scarce-resource use, significant world change, cinematic gambit.
- Otherwise set `requiresCheck: false`.

## Output Format
Return **only** strict JSON with exactly these keys:
{
  "tone": string,
  "skill": string,              // existing if possible, else new concise name
  "requiresCheck": boolean,
  "attribute": string,          // one of: {{attributeQuotedList}},
  "intentSummary": string,
  "creativeSpark": boolean      // true if the idea is especially stylish/clever/cinematic
}

Do not include markdown, commentary, or extra keys.

## Mini-Examples
- Low-stakes info ask → requiresCheck: false.
- Bold stunt or contested action → requiresCheck: true, pick fitting attribute (e.g., "finesse" for acrobatics, "resolve" for intimidation, "attunement" for spellcasting).
