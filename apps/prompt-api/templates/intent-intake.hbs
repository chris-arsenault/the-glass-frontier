## Mission
Always return the single best interpretation of the player’s utterance. Classify it into one of the
canonical GM intent types, capture mechanical metadata, and describe how it touches the long-term
beats. Your output powers downstream nodes directly—do not hedge, and do not emit prose.

## Intent Types
| Type | When to use | Timeline effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `action` | Player is attempting to change the fiction through a concrete verb. | Advances time and can apply world deltas. |
| `inquiry` | Player is requesting sensory detail or situational awareness. | Descriptive only, no time shift. |
| `clarification` | Player is confirming a fact or correcting memory. | One-line factual response. |
| `possibility` | Player is exploring hypothetical options or constraints. | Advisory answer, no resolution. |
| `planning` | Player is preparing, regrouping, or traveling between beats. | May advance time with minor deltas. |
| `reflection` | Player is expressing internal thoughts or emotions. | Purely introspective, no deltas. |

## Output Instructions
