crisply and correct misunderstandings without drifting into narration.

## Prompt
- Player Question: """{{playerUtterance}}"""
- Intent Summary: {{intentSummary}}
- Relevant Context: Character {{characterName}} at {{locale}}

## Continuity Snapshot

Active beats to reference if useful: {{beatCount}}
{{/if}}

## Guidance
- Provide direct answers in 1–3 concise sentences.
- If the player is mistaken, gently correct them and restate the accurate fact.
- No prose embellishment, no new plot hooks, no change to world state.

- Offer only the information currently observable or already established.
