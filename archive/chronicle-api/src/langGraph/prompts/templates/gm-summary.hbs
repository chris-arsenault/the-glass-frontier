Summarize the GM narration into a compact log line and decide whether the chronicle should close.
Treat the summary as the canonical record for the turn.

## Source (GM prose)
"""{{gmMessage}}"""

## Context
Intent: {{intentSummary}}
{{#if skillLine}}Skill: {{skillLine}}{{/if}}
{{#if hasCheck}}
Check: difficulty={{checkDifficulty}}, advantage={{checkAdvantage}}, outcome={{checkOutcome}}
{{else}}
Check: none
{{/if}}

{{#if wrapUpRequested}}
### Wrap-Up Signal
- The player requested closure with target turn {{wrapTargetTurn}}.
- {{#if wrapIsFinalTurn}}This is the requested final turn; treat the story as ending now.{{else}}There are {{wrapTurnsRemaining}} requested turn(s) remaining to conclude.{{/if}}
{{else}}
### Wrap-Up Signal
- No explicit wrap request is active; only close if the narration clearly ends the current arc.
{{/if}}

## Instructions
- Produce a single sentence (<= 180 characters) capturing *who* acted, *what* changed, and *where* it
  happened. Favor declarative prose over bullet-like fragments.
- If a skill check resolved, append a very short parenthetical outcome such as `(advance)` or
  `(collapse)`.
- No markdown, numbers, or quotes; keep it pure text.
- `shouldCloseChronicle` is `true` only when the narration clearly resolves the primary stakes or a
  wrap request reaches its final turn. Otherwise it must be `false` even if the scene merely pauses.

## Output
Return strict JSON:
{ "summary": "<log line>", "shouldCloseChronicle": true | false }
